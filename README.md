## You need to answer the following question. 
Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries of student information but in different orders.
Do they give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching? if not, why? use the data you obtain from you code to 
explain your answer. 


Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries but they will not give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching. Because, the datafile1 alphabet order but the datafile2 is in random order. For example, in this project when i search for my first name is "Xuan", it will take a pretty time to go through the list in datafile1 but in datafile2 is random, so when it go through the list, my name is kind of in middle so it takes shorter time in datafile1.The factthat binary trees take shape from the way in which they were created.
